# Automated Hours Messager

### Description
This little automation project was designed to keep my boss informed on when I would be in the office.

Each day I was to send him a message in the morning that let him know what times of the day I would be in and for how long. This Python script connects to the MessageMedia API, coupled with CRON jobs and some simple Python code it would automatically send the times that I had set within the code.

The next revision of the program came to help send messages for all of the interns by connecting to a central calendar that stored each interns times. This allowed me to work with an external outlook calendar to fetch information and process it.

This project is not currently in use, however, it is stored as a way to look back on my progress.
